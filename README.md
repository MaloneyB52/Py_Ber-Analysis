1. Overview of the analysis:
    This analysis was conducted to decipher driving and ride share profit opportunities for ride sharing businesses in various areas, these opportunities include the number of fares, average fare revenue and efficiency of drivers. 

2. Results:
     While it is not surprising that urban areas far outpace rural and suburban in both numbers of drivers available, but also sheer numbers of rides. However, numbers do not tell the whole story, as rural areas surprisingly beat urban returns in Bothe average fare per ride, and average fare per driver. This can be partially explained, circumstantially, by an assumption of the longer distances involved in rural areas, but the evidence is incomplete as to a factor.
    
 3. Summary:
     Despite rural data exceeding urban in two key areas we recommend a) focusing on the urban and suburban market due to volume, and b) continue to service rural areas, but with a greater focus on efficiency. Volume service alone in urban areas will absorb market forces, to a greater degree than rural and suburban, but you ignore a solid profit margin by completely ignoring rural areas
